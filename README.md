# Plugin GRU supply

## Introduction

This plugin manages notifications for the GRU. It stores them and sends the different parts of the notification to the dedicated systems.

## Encryption of customers

The plugin can use customers with encrypted ids. This mechanism permits to have a specific id for each service provider. Thus, the id is not shared.

To use encryption, the site has to contain a class implementing the interface `fr.paris.lutece.plugins.grubusiness.service.encryption.ICustomerEncryptionService` from the library `gru-library-grubusiness` . For example, add the plugin `gru-plugin-grukeydiversification` in the `pom.xml` of the site. The encryption is then enabled.

## Configuration

 **The Demand DAO** 

By default, the plugin uses a mock to store the demands. The demands are not stored. To use a correct storage mechanism, the bean `grusupply.storageService` defined in the Spring context must use a concrete implementation of `fr.paris.lutece.plugins.grubusiness.business.demand.IDemandDAO` from the library `gru-library-grubusiness` .

The known implementations are the following:
 
*  `fr.paris.lutece.plugins.grustoragedb.business.DemandDAO` from the plugin `gru-plugin-grustoragedb` . The demands are stored in the database.


 **The Notification DAO** 

By default, the plugin uses a mock to store the notifications. The notifications are not stored. To use a correct storage mechanism, the bean `grusupply.storageService` defined in the Spring context must use a concrete implementation of `fr.paris.lutece.plugins.grubusiness.business.notification.INotificationDAO` from the library `gru-library-grubusiness` .

The known implementations are the following:
 
*  `fr.paris.lutece.plugins.grustoragedb.business.NotificationDAO` from the plugin `gru-plugin-grustoragedb` . The notifications are stored in the database.
